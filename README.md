### This repository includes tasks which I've done during learning React library after 6th module of that course.

## Tasks:
### 1. Registration form - 'done'
This form checks:
-> if the entered password:
* contains at least one lowercase letter
* contains at least one uppercase letter
* contains at least one number
* contains at least one special character (e.g. # $%)
* its length is at least 8 characters
-> on blur if there is a user with given e-mail address in the database and if such e-mail exists in the database, the password fields and the button are disabled
If the fields does't meet the criteria, information about it are displayed below the field.
##
### 2. Step by step form - 'almost done'
This form has 3 steps where you are asked for your name, age and you can write your thoughts or anything. At the end you can submit your answers and the form is cleared.
##
### 3. Form with captcha - 'to do'
This form includes extra Captcha field to check if you are real person.

Thanks to the use of routing all of these excercises are put into one application and you can switch forms freely using navigation.
